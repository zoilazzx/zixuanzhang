    <p>
        Agriculture has long been a cornerstone of the national economy, playing a crucial role in food security and economic growth. Despite extensive research on agricultural efficiency and productivity, capacity utilization (CU) and environmental externalities have received limited attention. This study integrates economic and environmental factors to evaluate CU in Chinese agriculture. It extends the CU model to include undesirable outputs, measuring long-run CU using input and output-oriented exponential by-production technology. This comprehensive approach assesses China's agricultural capacity utilization (ACU), exploring both its overall level and spatial characteristics. The findings reveal significant disparities in ACU among provinces, with certain regions, such as Shandong, Henan, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, exhibiting notable levels of ACU. The central region exhibits relatively higher ACU levels, followed by the east, while the west performs poorly. Employing a panel Tobit regression model, the study examines factors influencing ACU, revealing diverse impacts. Factors such as environmental investment, urbanization rate, government support, and R&D investment variably affect ACU. This study contributes to the development of precise and effective agricultural policies, promoting greater efficiency and sustainability in Chinese agriculture.
