[Assessment and Determinants of Agricultural Plant Capacity Utilization in China: A Carbon Emission Perspective](/zixuanzhang/publicationPCU)

`Zixuan Zhang`, Lin Wang, Yue Li. *European Journal of Operational Research*. **(SCI, IF=6.4, Q1 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** "Plant capacity utilization, Data envelopment analysis, Agriculture Overcapacity, Environmental externality
- **Methods:** Extended the PCU model with undesirable outputs to a novel input and output-oriented long-run PCU measurement with by-product technology. Introduced an environmental PCU measure to capture the possible capacity of economic growth and pollution control. Explored factors influencing agricultural production efficiency using panel regression models, revealing the mechanisms behind their impacts.
- **Results:** Positive trends were observed in the comprehensive development of TWS. Coupling ranges from good to high-quality, and coordination progresses from near-dysfunctional to highly coordinated. The research revealed alternating effects of GDP water consumption and wastewater treatment rates on the water resources-water environment system and enduring promotional effects of sewage treatment rates and urban greening coverage on the water environment-water ecology subsystem. The findings lay the groundwork for innovative strategies to enhance the integrated and coordinated advancement of the TWS in the Yellow River Basin.

[Implications of supplier encroachment for strategies in upgraded products introduction](/zixuanzhang/publicationSun)

Lin Sun, `Zixuan Zhang*`. *Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice*. **(SCI, IF=6.4, Q1 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** "Plant capacity utilization, Data envelopment analysis, Agriculture Overcapacity, Environmental externality
- **Methods:** Provided an alternative yet complementary approach to analyze upgraded product introduction strategies in a dual-channel supply chain. Specifically, the focus was on addressing how internal competition (including vertical and horizontal competition) in a dual-channel supply chain created strategic issues in product upgrading that were significantly different from external competition from the market.
- **Results:** Revealed was the presence of vertical competition introduced by the retailer, which led to lower incentives for the manufacturer to upgrade products. Also found was that, contrary to conventional wisdom, horizontal competition did not necessarily lead to increased incentives for the manufacturer to invest in product upgrading.

[Comprehensive Evaluation of "Three Waters" Carrying Capacity and Path Evolution Study: A Case of the Yellow River Basin](/zixuanzhang/publication1)

`Zixuan Zhang`, Yue Li, Yangxi Lv, Xue Feng, Xudong Chen. *Science of The Total Environment*. **(SCI, IF=9.8, Q1 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** "Three Waters" System, Carrying Capacity, Alert Analysis, Pathway Evolution, System Dynamics
- **Methods:** Developed the Three Waters System Carrying Capacity (TWSCC) index using entropy weight-TOPSIS, SCIE, and ArcGIS tools. Analysed spatiotemporal variations and proposed differentiated developmental pathways. Applied System Dynamics modelling for dynamic simulation from 2020 to 2035.
- **Results:** The research findings indicate that from 2005 to 2020, the TWSCC levels across the nine provinces in the YRB consistently exhibited varying degrees of overload. The alert levels mostly remained in "Heavy warning" or "Medium warning" states. By 2035, the TWSCC under four development paths are improved from 2020, with the Green Environmental Protection-Oriented scheme reaching a safe carrying capacity level.

[Research on Optimized Allocation of Wastewater Emission Permits Based on the "Three Waters": a case of the Yellow River Basin in China](/zixuanzhang/publicationJEM)

Yue Li, `Zixuan Zhang`, Qiufeng Zhang, Xue Feng. *Journal of Environmental Management*. **(SCI, IF=8.7, Q2 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** "Wastewater emission permits, Multi-objective optimized allocation, "Three Waters" system, Ecological compensation, Yellow River Basin
- **Methods:** An innovative scheme was proposed for the allocation of WEPs and ecological compensation, considering the coordinated development of the TWS in the watershed. The scheme was solved and analyzed using the improved NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm and TOPSIS decision theory.
- **Results:** Taking the Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China as an example, the equity of this optimized allocation scheme was as high as 0.21, which was 41.67% higher than that of the initial allocation scheme (base year). The amount of discharge was 1.22 billion tons, representing a 27.81% reduction in discharge, and the TWCC of the basin was 0.76, 36.21% higher than that of the base year.

[Analysis on the coupling coordination characteristics and key factors between high-quality economic development and water resource carrying capacity for cities in the Yangtze River Basin](/zixuanzhang/publication2)

Yang Shuhui, `Zixuan Zhang`, Yu Keyao, Zhigang Li. *Sustainable Cities and Society*. **(SCI, IF=11.7, Q1 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** High-quality economic development, Water resources carrying capacity, Coupled coordination relationships, Basin cities
- **Methods:** Utilized the CRITIC-TOPSIS method to compute comprehensive indices for high-quality economic development and water resource carrying capacity in 53 cities. Employed coupling models, coordination measures, and a random panel Tobit regression model to evaluate and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors affecting coordination.
- **Results:** Cities in the Yangtze River Basin exhibit an upgraded coupling coordination level, shifting from dispersion to concentration. Hotspots are concentrated downstream, while cold spots are in the middle and upper reaches. Regional aggregation capacity, economic development level, and urban greenery positively influence coordination in mainstream, tributary, and central basin cities, respectively. Environmental governance capacity negatively impacts coordination in tributary cities. The study provides decision-making references for planning and construction in the Yangtze River Basin cities.

[Collaborative Optimal Allocation of Water Resources and Sewage Discharge Rights in Watershed Cities: Considering Equity among Water Sectors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-28664-w)

Mingkang Yuan, Yue Li, `Zixuan Zhang`, Lin Wang. *Environmental Science and Pollution Research*. **(SCI, IF=5.19, Q2)**

- **Keywords:** Water, Sewage discharge right, Collaborative allocation, Equity, Multi-objective optimization
- **Methods:** Developed a multi-objective optimization model incorporating sewage discharge rights into watershed water resource allocation. Utilized the Gini coefficient to balance equity and economic aspects across water sectors, considering distinct water demands and sewage discharge requirements.
- **Results:** Simultaneous optimization of Gini coefficients for water demand and sewage discharge rights allocation with consistent trends. The increased importance of sewage discharge improves fairness in water distribution but reduces the return on investment for domestic and industrial water use. Proper allocation of sewage discharge rights enhances the economic value of agricultural water use. This strategy holds promise for improving both equality and economic benefits in the water supply system, ensuring sustainable water and sewage rights utilization in basin cities.
