[Implications of supplier encroachment for strategies in upgraded products introduction](/zixuanzhang/publicationSun)

`Zixuan Zhang`, Lin Sun, Wei Yan. *Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice*. **(IF=6.4, JCR Q1 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** Competitive strategy, Dual-channel supply chain, Durable goods, Game theory
- **Methods:** Provided an alternative yet complementary approach to analyze upgraded product introduction strategies in a dual-channel supply chain. Specifically, the focus was on addressing how internal competition (including vertical and horizontal competition) in a dual-channel supply chain created strategic issues in product upgrading that were significantly different from external competition from the market.
- **Results:** Revealed was the presence of vertical competition introduced by the retailer, which led to lower incentives for the manufacturer to upgrade products. Also found was that, contrary to conventional wisdom, horizontal competition did not necessarily lead to increased incentives for the manufacturer to invest in product upgrading.

[Coupling Coordination Evaluation and Sustainable Development of ‚ÄúThree Waters‚Äù System and Impulse Response Analysis in the Yellow River Basin](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2024.105174)

Yue Li, Yangxi Lv, `Zixuan Zhang`, Xue Feng, Xudong Chen. *Sustainable Cities and Society*. **(IF=11.7, JCR Q1 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** "Three Water" system, Coupled coordination, Impulse response, Evaluation indicator, Yellow River Basin
- **Methods:** Established a coupling coordination model and employed Vector Auto Regression (VAR) to analyze key indicators' influence on the sustainable development of the ‚ÄúThree Waters‚Äù system (TWS) from 2005 to 2021.
- **Results:** Positive trends were observed in the comprehensive development of TWS. Coupling ranges from good to high-quality, and coordination progresses from near-dysfunctional to highly coordinated. The research revealed alternating effects of GDP water consumption and wastewater treatment rates on the water resources-water environment system and enduring promotional effects of sewage treatment rates and urban greening coverage on the water environment-water ecology subsystem. The findings lay the groundwork for innovative strategies to enhance the integrated and coordinated advancement of the TWS in the Yellow River Basin.

[Analysis on the coupling coordination characteristics and key factors between high-quality economic development and water resource carrying capacity for cities in the Yangtze River Basin](/zixuanzhang/publication2)

Yang Shuhui, `Zixuan Zhang`, Yu Keyao, Zhigang Li. *Sustainable Cities and Society*. **(IF=11.7, JCR Q1 TOP)**

- **Keywords:** High-quality economic development, Water resources carrying capacity, Coupled coordination relationships, Basin cities
- **Methods:** Utilized the CRITIC-TOPSIS method to compute comprehensive indices for high-quality economic development and water resource carrying capacity in 53 cities. Employed coupling models, coordination measures, and a random panel Tobit regression model to evaluate and analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics and influencing factors affecting coordination.
- **Results:** Cities in the Yangtze River Basin exhibit an upgraded coupling coordination level, shifting from dispersion to concentration. Hotspots are concentrated downstream, while cold spots are in the middle and upper reaches. Regional aggregation capacity, economic development level, and urban greenery positively influence coordination in mainstream, tributary, and central basin cities, respectively. Environmental governance capacity negatively impacts coordination in tributary cities. The study provides decision-making references for planning and construction in the Yangtze River Basin cities.

[Collaborative Optimal Allocation of Water Resources and Sewage Discharge Rights in Watershed Cities: Considering Equity among Water Sectors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-28664-w)

Mingkang Yuan, Yue Li, `Zixuan Zhang`, Lin Wang. *Environmental Science and Pollution Research*. **(IF=5.19, JCR Q2)**

- **Keywords:** Water, Sewage discharge right, Collaborative allocation, Equity, Multi-objective optimization
- **Methods:** Developed a multi-objective optimization model incorporating sewage discharge rights into watershed water resource allocation. Utilized the Gini coefficient to balance equity and economic aspects across water sectors, considering distinct water demands and sewage discharge requirements.
- **Results:** Simultaneous optimization of Gini coefficients for water demand and sewage discharge rights allocation with consistent trends. The increased importance of sewage discharge improves fairness in water distribution but reduces the return on investment for domestic and industrial water use. Proper allocation of sewage discharge rights enhances the economic value of agricultural water use. This strategy holds promise for improving both equality and economic benefits in the water supply system, ensuring sustainable water and sewage rights utilization in basin cities.
